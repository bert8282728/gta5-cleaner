## Building

### Source Code
Git Repository: [https://github.com/ganeshh123/gta5-cleaner](https://github.com/ganeshh123/gta5-cleaner)

### Running on Node
1. Clone/Download the project and copy app.js and essentialFiles.js into the GTA 5 Installation root directory.

2. Open Command Prompt inside the GTA V Installation root directory and run ```node app.js```


### Compiling a Windows Executable
Executables are compiled with a very [specific version of nexe](https://github.com/cspotcode/nexe/tree/fix-vfs) that allows access to the filesystem, which has a tricky setup procedure.

#### Installing the correct version of nexe
Run **install_nexe_win.bat** as admin on **Windows**, will take about 5 minutes to install fully.

Alternatively, install manually like this:

1. Firstly, install the general [nexe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nexe) globally with the command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g nexe
    ```
2. In the project root folder build some executables with this version of nexe to download node binaries for Windows:

    ```bash
    nexe . --target win32-x86-10.13.0
    ```

    This will download the binaries we need for later, and delete the executables built with this for now.

3. Now we need to install a [specific version of nexe](https://github.com/cspotcode/nexe/tree/fix-vfs) that allows access to the filesystem:

    Run the command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g cspotcode/nexe#19a5046
    ```

Now we should have the correct version of nexe for building.

Confirm by running:

```bash
nexe -v
```
Check that the version is `4.0.0-beta.4`

#### Compiling the exe
Run **build_win32.bat** on **Windows** to build a Windows Executable. This can be found in /dist.

To Compile Manually

To build a Windows Executable, run the command:
```bash
nexe . --target win32-x86-10.13.0 -o ./dist/gta5cleaner.exe
```
in the root directory of the project.
